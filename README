Setting up Cilk
---------------
I downloaded the Cilk source-code from the MIT Cilk Project's page:
http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/cilk/

Then ./configure & make & make check & make install

After this, write your cilk code, with three major keywords, cilk, spawn, and sync. 

Compilation is similar to gcc. Use cilkc as the compiler. Eg:
cilkc -O2 hello-world.cilk -o hello-world
