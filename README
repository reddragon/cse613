Setting up Cilk
---------------
Download the Cilk++ SDK from http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/download-intel-cilk-sdk/

The cilk++ compiler is located in the bin/ folder in the archive that you will receive.

After this, write your cilk code, with three major keywords, cilk_main, cilk_spawn, and cilk_sync. 

Compilation is similar to gcc. Use cilk++ as the compiler. Eg:
cilk++ -O2 hello-world.cilk -o hello-world
